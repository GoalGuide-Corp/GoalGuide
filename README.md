# Goal Guide - INDY 6

**Your Path... One Step At A Time**

As humans, we all have goals we want to achieve. We set goals for learning, exercise, our careers, etc. While the desire to accomplish these goals is commendable, getting started can be a daunting task that hinders us from ever getting to the desired outcome. 

Our GoalGuide app will help users with the most important step of accomplishing a goal. We help them form a plan. Using the power of AI, the user tells the app what goal they would like to work on. The plan created then helps them to accomplish small goals and visualize the next steps required for their success. By helping users visualize the steps, we strive to make goals less intimidating and more achievable for everyone.
